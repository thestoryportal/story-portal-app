Pull related brainstorming and ideation threads as creative fuel for: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Search for related discussions:
   ```bash
   node "./tools/ai/history/search-history.js" "$ARGUMENTS"
   node "./tools/ai/history/search-history.js" "$ARGUMENTS idea"
   node "./tools/ai/history/search-history.js" "$ARGUMENTS could"
   node "./tools/ai/history/search-history.js" "$ARGUMENTS maybe"
   ```
2. Extract:
   - Ideas that were proposed but not implemented
   - Alternative approaches that were considered
   - "What if" discussions
   - Related features or concepts mentioned
3. Present as inspiration, not constraints:
   - These are starting points for new thinking
   - Some ideas may have been rejected for reasons that no longer apply
   - Combine old ideas with new capabilities

Goal: Surface creative threads from history to spark new directions, not to limit thinking to past ideas.
