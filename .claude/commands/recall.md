Search the development chat history for context about: $ARGUMENTS

This is reference material, not binding decisions. Evaluate findings critically.

Steps:
1. Run: `node "./tools/ai/history/search-history.js" "$ARGUMENTS"`
2. If no results, try broader terms or check `node "./tools/ai/history/search-history.js" --topic <keyword>`
3. Summarize what was found:
   - Key discussions and context
   - Decisions made (note if they may be outdated)
   - Any unresolved questions or alternatives considered
4. Apply this context to the current work, but reason independently about whether past approaches still make sense
