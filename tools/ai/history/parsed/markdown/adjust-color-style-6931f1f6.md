Use this color as a style reference for adjusting the teal patina colors: #6AA1A6
Use this color as a style reference for adjusting the brown brass colors: #967F64

Keep the image exactly as it is other than the color adjustments. Work within a small tight range of colors from exactly the provided style reference colors to slight close variants to ensure a dynamic textured color application.

This isn't patina but rather a flat coloring of all teal patina color. You are only adjusting the patina colors to match the style reference color and the brass browns to match its style reference.
