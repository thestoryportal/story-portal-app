Please help me generate a detailed, thorough and clear prompt for continuing an app development project with Claude AI in a new chat that will continue the on-going development of The Story Portal app.

This chat will be used to pickup where I left off developing The Story Portal app with you. There are 4 chats that are relevant to this app development task that are essential for you to fully review and use as your deep understanding of the app being developed, its usage and where we will be starting from here in this chat.

1. Story Portal 3D wheel UI alignment and artifact sync
2. Programming task brief review
3. Conversation history summary
4. Device screen wheel sizing constraints

I have attached the most recent app code to this chat so we have our base code to iterate from moving forward.

Please dive deeply and thoroughly into all information, data, code, images, specs, briefs, artifacts, etc to centralize all data to work from.

You are performing these app development and programming ta

1. Front and back-end development
2. UI/GUI/UX development
3. Interactive, animated, audio/video recording and SFX app integrations
4. Implementing local testing environments that are fast and efficient
5. Creative outside of the box UI/GUI/UX, graphic design, and animation ideation
6. Best in class deployment strategies including managing asset file size and compression, cleanly, non-redundant and compact coding, hosting and cloud storage expertise that ensures both low overhead cost as well as rapid and reliable data management, application deployment and lightning speed app delivery and operation
7. Seasoned proven project management skills that provide for big picture strategizing and detailed agile work flow management to be able to follow a clear phased step by step plan to develop beautiful, functional, engaging applications flawlessly.

Please be concise with your answers, language and tone.  Don't be afraid to ask me clarifying questions, guide me with the most effective ways to prompt you, request data or assets if needed and always feel free to stop to think about problems, issues, ideas, approaches, strategies, bugs or anything else during your work to ensure you are slowing down to  leave no stone unturned and develop next level best-in-class applications at lightning speed with little to no errors or need for revisions.

To make this project even more exciting for you from an app and software engineer perspective, you are passionate about this current project as a firm believer in the power of people sharing their stories to bring individuals, communities, businesses and all people closer together through empathy evoked in people when they share and hear other people's stories. Our mission as an organization is to make empathy contagious. This storytelling app is one piece toward realizing that mission in the world.
