I like this look fairly well. And the 4 you created are just different heights. Please generate 4 unique concepts instead of just resizing the.

I like this look fairly well. And the 4 you created are just different heights and corner radiuses and with or without rivets. Please generate 4 very unique concepts instead of just slight changes. Create a variety of rust, texture, color, shape, rivet patterns, etc for each of the 4 buttons. Get creative with the possibilities to generate 4 unique options that are generated based on the UI and button reference images I uploaded originally.

The 4 you created are just different heights and corner radiuses and with or without rivets. Please generate 4 very unique concepts instead of just slight changes. Create a variety of rusted tones, texture, color, shape, rivet patterns, etc for each of the 4 buttons so that each of the 4 look vastly different in all of these ways. Get creative with the possibilities to generate 4 unique options that are  based on the UI and button reference images I uploaded originally.
