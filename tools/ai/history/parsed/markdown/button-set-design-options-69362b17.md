Here's a **tailored and optimized prompt** you can use with ChatGPT (or any advanced image-generating model that supports detailed prompts like DALL·E 3, Midjourney, or SDXL) to generate **six steampunk-style button sets** matching your **Story Portal App interface** requirements.

### ✅ FINAL PROMPT TO GENERATE BUTTON SETS:

> **Prompt:**
> 
> Generate six different button set design options in high resolution as transparent PNGs, matching the steampunk style of the provided UI reference image. Each button set should include the following buttons, each in both static and clicked (pressed) states:
> 
> **Story Wheel Interaction Buttons:**
> - New Topics  
> - Record  
> - Spin the Wheel!  
> - How to Play  
> 
> **App Navigation Buttons:**
> - My Stories  
> - About Us
> 
> **Design requirements:**
> - Buttons must reflect a consistent **steampunk aesthetic**: aged metal, rivets, mechanical accents, gauges, brass, copper, rusted steel, etc.
> - Shape and size must be large enough to fit the full text of each label (but text should NOT be included in the final images).
> - Group similar buttons together with shared design elements:
>   - “New Topics” and “Record” are primary, same shape and style.
>   - “My Stories” and “About Us” are secondary, matching each other in style.
>   - “How to Play” is smaller and distinct from others.
> - Ensure a clearly visible visual change between static and clicked states for each button (e.g. shadow depth, light angle, pressed-in effect, slight color shift).
> - Each button should be rendered individually as a high-resolution transparent PNG.
> - Do not include any text on the buttons.
> - Do not place the buttons onto the uploaded interface – only design the button assets using it as a visual and stylistic reference.
> 
> Deliver 6 distinct button set styles, each with all button variations described above (both static and clicked states).

### 🛠 Why This Prompt Works:

1. **Clear Output Expectation** – Requests **six full button sets**, with static + clicked states, and image format (high-res PNG with transparency).
2. **Style Accuracy** – Describes **steampunk visuals** referencing your provided UI image, without requesting actual reuse.
3. **Functional Grouping** – Clarifies functional differences between button categories (important for visual hierarchy).
4. **No Text Instruction** – Prevents AI from placing unwanted text.
5. **Scalable** – Can be used with most image generation models that support design/UI output.

Would you like me to **convert this into Midjourney or DALL·E-compatible syntax** as well?

One addition for clarification please: that these buttons will be used on the uploaded interface, so they must be designed to be used in the UI. The UI is indeed a reference and rendered buttons will not be rendered here overlaid on the uploaded UI. But they must work seamlessly with the UI once implemented.

Perfect clarification — that addition ensures the visual harmony between the button sets and the existing UI design, while keeping the rendering separate.

Here's the **refined and finalized prompt** incorporating your clarification:

### ✅ FINAL ENGINEERED PROMPT:

> **Prompt:**
> 
> Generate six different button set design options in high resolution as transparent PNGs, matching the steampunk style of the provided UI reference image. Each button set should include the following buttons, each in both static and clicked (pressed) states:
> 
> ---
> **Story Wheel Interaction Buttons:**
> - New Topics  
> - Record  
> - Spin the Wheel!  
> - How to Play  
> 
> **App Navigation Buttons:**
> - My Stories  
> - About Us  
> ---
> 
> **Design Requirements:**
> - Buttons must be visually cohesive with the steampunk interface shown in the provided reference image (featuring rusted metal, bolts, gears, copper/brass tones, pressure gauges, etc.).
> - These buttons will **be implemented into the provided UI**, so they must match the **color scheme, lighting, and texture** of that interface. However, do **not render the buttons over the UI** — design them as standalone assets based on it.
> - Button shapes and sizes must be large enough to visually accommodate the full label text (provided above), **but do not include any text** in the rendered buttons.
> - Button groupings should be visually distinct as follows:
>   - “New Topics” and “Record” share the same look and layout as primary interaction buttons.
>   - “My Stories” and “About Us” should match each other in style as secondary navigation buttons.
>   - “Spin the Wheel!” should have a more prominent, eye-catching design.
>   - “How to Play” should be smaller and clearly differentiated from others in visual hierarchy.
> - Design each button in **two states**: 
>   - Static (default)  
>   - Clicked (pressed-in or activated look: e.g., lighting shift, inner shadow, depth press)
> 
> **Output Format:**
> - Each button must be delivered as a high-resolution **transparent PNG**.
> - Each button should be provided **individually**, not composited together.
> - No text or UI overlays should be included.
> - Provide six distinct full sets, each set containing all buttons in both states.

Would you like me to prepare a **version of this prompt for Midjourney v6** or another image model?

### 👤 USER (2025-12-08T01:44:25.734Z)

One final addition please: let's make sure the button sets are created high resolution and each button set image is as large as a computer full screen so that when each individual button is placed in the UI they can be scaled down and up with no resolution lost.

---

### 🤖 ASSISTANT (2025-12-08T01:44:26.618Z)

Great final addition — specifying **full-screen resolution per button set** ensures scalability and professional visual quality.

Here is the **final, fully engineered prompt** with all of your requirements clearly integrated:

> ---
> 
> **Design Requirements:**
> - Buttons must be stylistically aligned with the **steampunk interface** in the provided reference image — incorporating materials and elements such as weathered metal, rivets, gears, brass, copper, gauges, and aged textures.
> - These buttons **will be implemented in the provided interface**, so they must match the interface’s **lighting, color palette, and texture** — but should be rendered **separately**, not placed on the UI image.
> - Each button must be large enough to accommodate the provided text labels (but **no text** should appear in the image).
> - Group buttons visually as follows:
>   - “New Topics” and “Record” should be visually paired, matching in shape and style.
>   - “My Stories” and “About Us” should be visually cohesive with each other.
>   - “Spin the Wheel!” should be more prominent and eye-catching.
>   - “How to Play” should be smaller and visually distinct from the others.
> - Each button should include two distinct states:
>   - **Static (default)**
>   - **Clicked (pressed)** — with clear visual changes like lighting, shadows, or depth shift.
> 
> **Output Specifications:**
> - Deliver each button set as **individual high-resolution transparent PNGs**.
> - Each **button set image** should be rendered at **full computer screen size (minimum 1920x1080 pixels or larger)** to allow buttons to be **scaled up or down without any resolution loss** when integrated into the UI.
> - Render buttons individually, not combined with the UI, and with no text or labels overlaid.
