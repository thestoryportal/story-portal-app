Help me expand this prompt. What is the average cost and amount of time that it takes to build a professional parade float, such as those that are used in events like the Parade of Lights in Denver, the Rose Parade, Macy's, or any other parade, perhaps Mardi Gras, or any others that are out in the world?

Great — here’s an **expanded and improved version of your prompt**, followed by a short breakdown of why it works better:

---

### ✅ Expanded Prompt:

> **"Provide a detailed breakdown of the average cost and time required to build a professional parade float, such as those featured in high-profile events like the Parade of Lights in Denver, the Rose Parade in Pasadena, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, and Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Include:**
>
> - **A comparison across different parade types and locations.**
> - **Cost categories (materials, labor, design, transport, etc.).**
> - **Time estimates for each major phase (design, construction, decoration, testing).**
> - **Any differences between commercial/corporate floats vs. community/volunteer floats.**
> - **Historical or current examples to support the data if possible.**
>
> Structure the response in a clear and informative way, using bullet points or tables where useful."**

### 🔍 Why This Prompt Is Better:

- **Specificity:** You mention the kinds of parades you're interested in (Rose Parade, Mardi Gras, etc.), but the new version breaks it down into clear sub-tasks and comparisons.
- **Comprehensive Request:** It guides the model to break down costs, time, and variations, instead of giving a general number.
- **Flexible Output Format:** Suggests the use of bullets or tables for clarity — helps when working with structured data.

Let me know if you want this turned into a prompt specifically for data analysis, research summary, or writing an article or blog post — I can tailor it further.
