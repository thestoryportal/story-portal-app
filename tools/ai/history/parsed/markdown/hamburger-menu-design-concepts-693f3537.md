The gear is to elongated and needs to be perfectly round. The spacing between the hamburger menu lines needs to be smaller. The engraved effect must be blended into the gear background using a CSS type blend effect. The gear is too brown and must pull in more of the patina colors as highlights. You cropped the right side of the UI, make sure you use the full width of the image provided. Add a drop shadow to the gear that matched the drop shadows of the How to Play and My Stories buttons. Remove the rivets on the gear teeth. Do not change anything else except the items I have outlined here. Everything else MUST remain exactly the same.
