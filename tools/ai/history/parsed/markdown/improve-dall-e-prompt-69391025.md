Here is an **improved, highly detailed DALL·E prompt** that reflects your requirements with clarity, depth, and visual specificity:

---

**🔧 Improved DALL·E Prompt:**

> Replace each grey placeholder shape in the existing steampunk interface with visually rich, high-detail steampunk UI buttons. **Preserve the entire machine wall, porthole, pipes, and all surrounding textures, colors, and lighting exactly as they are. Do not alter the background or its structure.**  
>  
> - For the **circular grey shape above the porthole**, insert a **round steampunk-style push button** that looks like a large **emergency stop (e-stop)** control. Design it in **brass with teal patina accents**, a **slightly domed surface**, and **heavy industrial housing** with bolts or rivets around the perimeter. The button should look **playful and tactile**, as if it activates a mechanical spinning wheel. Make sure the **center is left blank for future text**, and do **not** include any labels or icons.  
>  
> - For the **two rounded rectangle shapes at the bottom**, replace them with **matching pill-shaped brass control plates**. These should appear as **interactive steampunk buttons**, slightly raised from the panel using a **subtle bevel effect**. Embellish them with **weathered brass textures**, **patina-edged borders**, and **small symmetrical rivets** around the perimeter. Ensure both buttons are **identical in style and size**, reflecting a unified design system. These are secondary controls, so they should feel important but **less visually dominant** than the circular e-stop button above. The **centers must remain blank** for future text; **no icons or labels** should be present.  
>  
> Apply the **exact color palette and lighting of the current interface**: **weathered copper, teal verdigris, warm rust tones**, and **soft warm lighting from the upper left**. Ensure all buttons cast **realistic soft shadows** onto the metal wall surface, consistent with the existing lighting direction, to make them appear **physically mounted and tangible**.
