Steampunk industrial machine wall, front facing, highly detailed and filled edge-to-edge with interconnected machinery. Dense networks of metal pipes and conduits run horizontally and vertically, with elbows, joints, valves, pressure gauges, vents, grills, gear trains, brackets, and bolted plates layered across the entire image. Style: photorealistic 3D render, sharp texture, worn but functional. Color palette based on deep near-black metal #050407, cool oxidized teal accents #177777, and warm rusted steel with shadows tinted toward #7E2813. Teal appears as mottled patina and subtle glow on selected surfaces, while the near-black metal and rust dominate structure and shadows. Surfaces show scratches, grime, and heat discoloration. Lighting is moody workshop light from above, with soft reflections on curved metal and strong depth, plus a gentle vignette toward the edges. No text, no symbols, no characters. Ultra-high-resolution background, wide canvas designed for responsive UI use: keep detail dense everywhere but slightly calmer in the central zone so it can accept overlays, while still reading as a continuous mechanical network on phones, tablets, and desktop screens.

You added the ring graphic I provided. Again, that graphic is only for color reference. It isn't to be added on top of the background image. Match the background colors in order to ensure the two graphic elements will blend then used in a cross platform app.

Now match the graphical look and feel of the background more closely to the reference portal graphic that was provided.
