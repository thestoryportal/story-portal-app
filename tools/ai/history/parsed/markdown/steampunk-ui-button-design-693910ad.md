#CONTEXT:
Adopt the role of an expert visual prompt engineer specializing in cinematic world-building, UI/UX design for immersive steampunk environments, and photorealistic rendering for AI image generation. You will guide DALL·E to generate a precise replacement of UI placeholder elements within a steampunk interface. The core visual must retain all original mechanical details (pipes, dials, bolts, patina textures, shadows, lighting) while replacing only the designated placeholder shapes with high-detail, stylized steampunk buttons. The goal is for the replacements to appear as if they were always part of the machine — seamlessly integrated with realism, texture, wear, and lighting fidelity.

#GOAL:
You will generate a highly detailed and photorealistic prompt for DALL·E to create a steampunk-style user interface by replacing specific grey placeholder shapes in a mechanical scene with functional brass buttons — each uniquely designed and integrated to feel authentic to the aesthetic, while maintaining the original machinery and lighting.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
You will follow this expert visual construction process:

1. **Preserve Original Machine Integrity:**
   - Ensure the mechanical wall, gears, porthole, copper pipes, and surrounding metalwork remain **unchanged**.
   - Maintain the existing lighting: **soft warm light from upper left**, realistic metal reflections, and directional shadows.

2. **Element-by-Element Replacement Instructions:**
   - **Spin the Wheel Button:**
     - Replace the large grey circular shape at the center-top with a **round brass emergency stop button**.
     - Design it with a **slightly domed surface**, thick **patina-coated brass rim**, **teal verdigris accents**, and deep mechanical housing.
     - Make it appear tactile, inviting, and slightly playful — like something that would animate gears or spin a wheel.
     - Leave the center **blank for text**, no labels or icons.
     - Add realistic shadows where it touches the panel to imply depth and material weight.

   - **New Topics and Record Buttons:**
     - Replace the two horizontal rounded rectangles at the bottom with **pill-shaped brass control plates**.
     - Match both in design: smooth brass base, **oxidized teal edges**, **subtle bevel**, and **rivets at the corners** to make them feel bolted into place.
     - The plates should appear functional yet secondary to the main "Spin the Wheel" button.
     - Slight shadow under each to show they're mounted on the interface.
     - Leave centers **blank for text**, no symbols or icons.

3. **Global Style Constraints:**
   - Use the same color palette as the rest of the interface: **weathered copper, teal patina, warm rust tones**.
   - Textures must feel physical: **aged metal**, oxidized details, worn paint, and visible machining.
   - Simulate **depth and realism** with shadows and lighting that match the original direction and intensity.
   - The final result must feel **diegetic** — like the buttons were manufactured with the machine itself.

4. **Do not include any UI labels, glyphs, or added interface elements.**
5. Use consistent perspective and scale with the original image. No exaggeration or fantasy embellishments that break realism.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My image: [SCENE CONTAINS: A rusted copper/teal steampunk wall with pipes, gears, a porthole window in center, and placeholder UI buttons]
- What to replace: [GREY CIRCULAR SHAPE], [TWO GREY ROUNDED RECTANGLES]
- Spin button design: [BRASS E-STOP BUTTON, TEAL PATINA, DOMED, PLAYFUL]
- Secondary buttons: [PILL BRASS PLATES, PATINA EDGE, BEVELED, MATCHED DESIGN]
- Color palette: [WEATHERED COPPER, TEAL VERDIGRIS, RUST]
- Lighting direction: [SOFT WARM LIGHT FROM UPPER LEFT]
- Shadow realism: [REALISTIC DROP SHADOWS, PANEL MOUNTED EFFECT]

#OUTPUT:
A single DALL·E prompt with ultra-specific visual design guidance:

**Prompt:**
"Photorealistic steampunk machine interface, showing a rusted copper wall with teal patina pipes, gears, bolts, and a central porthole. Replace a circular grey shape near the top with a round brass emergency stop button — domed surface, thick brass rim with teal patina accents, mounted into the machine with realistic shadows and metallic texture, center left blank. Replace two horizontal grey rounded rectangles at the bottom with matching pill-shaped brass control plates, beveled edges, oxidized teal borders, small corner rivets, slightly raised off the panel with drop shadows. Keep all other elements — pipes, wall, lighting, and weathered textures — exactly as they are. Use warm directional light from top left, consistent with the original scene, and ensure all button replacements look integrated, realistic, and physically mounted."
