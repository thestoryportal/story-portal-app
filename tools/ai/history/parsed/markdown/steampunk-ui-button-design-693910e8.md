Prompt:  
“Ultra-photorealistic **edit of the provided steampunk machine interface**, keeping the original image, composition, and 16:9 framing exactly the same. Preserve every existing element of the wall: all copper and teal-patina pipes, pressure gauges, gears, bolts, riveted plates, shadows, and the central porthole window with the wooden slats and text inside. Do not move, resize, or recolor the porthole or any part of the machinery; only replace the three flat grey UI placeholders.

At the position of the **grey circular placeholder near the top/center**, create a round **brass emergency stop button** that is exactly the same size and location as the placeholder. Give it a slightly domed face, a thick patina-coated brass rim, and subtle teal verdigris collected in crevices and around the bolts. Its housing should look deeply set into the metal panel with a short cylindrical collar, as if it could trigger the mechanical wheel. Make it tactile and a bit playful but still realistic and industrial. Add crisp, soft drop shadows and specular highlights that match the existing warm light from the upper left. Leave the center surface perfectly blank with no text, icons, or symbols.

At the positions of the **two horizontal grey rounded rectangles near the bottom**, create matching **pill-shaped brass control plates** that are exactly the same dimensions and positions as the placeholders. Both plates should share the same design: a smooth brushed-brass face, gently beveled so they appear slightly raised from the wall, with oxidized teal patina along the outer edges and around fasteners. Place small round rivets at the ends (or corners) to make them feel bolted into the machine. Under each plate, add a thin, soft shadow consistent with the existing lighting so they feel firmly mounted to the panel. Leave the interior area of each plate clean and blank for future labels — no engraved text, no icons, no glowing effects.

Use the **same color palette** as the surrounding interface: weathered copper, teal verdigris, warm rust tones, and soft warm highlights. All metals should show believable wear: fine scratches, small chips, subtle grime in seams, and slightly uneven patina. Match the global **lighting direction from the upper left**, with realistic reflections and shading so the new buttons feel like they were manufactured with the original machine. Do **not** introduce any new UI elements, labels, gauges, screens, cables, or background changes. The final image should look like an unmodified photograph of the original steampunk wall, except that the three grey placeholders have become fully integrated, high-detail brass buttons.”
