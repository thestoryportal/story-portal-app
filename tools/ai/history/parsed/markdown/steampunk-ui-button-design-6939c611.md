Make the round brass push button 20% smaller but keep the exact same design of it.

Remove the gear that surrounds the spin button, leaving just the brass dome button. Everything else remains exactly as it is.

The spin button is now very blurry. It please needs to be as sharp and clean as the rest of the interface, as sharp as the two pill shaped buttons. It must be obvious that it is a button in the interface.

This image sharpened the entire interface and now all of the graphics are not usable. I was asking only for the spin button to be made less blurry. Just making the spin button less blurry and sharper, nothing else changes from the image you generated prior to this one.
