### 👤 USER (2025-03-05T22:52:57.063Z)

Please expand this prompt:

I am in the planning stages of developing a cross platform app for mobile devices and browser based website called The Story Portal. The application is designed to engage people in personal storytelling in a unique way. The central feature of the app is spinning a price is right style wheel that has 20 story topic prompts at a time loaded on it. The user spins the wheel and it lands on a prompt. The user then is able to press a record button and record and share the story they are inspired to tell based on the topic. Each user has a profile with all their stories on it. Users connect with each other through a social networking feature. There is then a feed where all users can see stories that have been recorded when they login. They can listen to the stories in their feed. The user can also sort their feed based on each story prompt topic as well as by those they are connected to as friends on the social networking feature. Prompts beyond the 20 on the wheel are available and can be randomly and manually swapped before spinning. All of these are default prompts without user customization.

There will also be paid features:

1. Purchase specific story topic packs such as adult themes, family themes, etc.

2. Purchase a private space to collect stories among a group of people such as family, friends, organizations, etc. This feature will allow full customization of the wheel’s story topic prompts and the ability to invite people to be a part of the private group paid on a per person license fee.

We don’t have the budget to pay developers to build this from the ground up. We do have some front end dev skills and access to graphic designers. Given this reality we are planning on leveraging AI to develop the app for mobile devices as well as website. We need to work with the best AI models and tools to accomplish this.

Please give me a detailed analysis and guidance on how to effectively accomplish this.

### **Expanded Prompt: Guidance for Developing "The Story Portal" Using AI and Low-Code/No-Code Solutions**  

#### **Project Overview:**  
I am in the planning stages of developing a **cross-platform storytelling application** called *The Story Portal*, which will be available as both a **mobile app (iOS and Android)** and a **browser-based web platform**. The application is designed to engage users in **personal storytelling** through a unique and interactive format.  

#### **Core Features:**  
1. **Storytelling Wheel Mechanic:**  
   - Users engage by spinning a **"Price Is Right"-style wheel** that contains **20 preloaded story prompts** at a time.  
   - The wheel randomly lands on a prompt, and the user records a **story based on the selected topic**.  
   - The story is then saved and shared within the app.  

2. **User Profiles & Social Features:**  
   - Each user has a **personal profile** that stores all their recorded stories.  
   - A **social networking feature** allows users to connect and follow each other.  
   - A **feed** displays recorded stories from connected users and the broader community.  

3. **Customization & Organization:**  
   - Users can filter their feed by **story prompt topics** or by stories from **friends and connections**.  
   - Additional prompts (beyond the default 20) can be randomly or manually swapped before spinning.  
   - **Story prompts are preloaded and not user-customizable by default**.  

#### **Monetization & Premium Features:**  
We plan to include **paid features** to generate revenue:  
1. **Themed Story Packs:** Users can purchase **specific topic packs** (e.g., adult themes, family themes) to expand their storytelling experience.  
2. **Private Storytelling Spaces:** Users can create **private groups** (e.g., for families, friends, or organizations) with the following benefits:  
   - **Fully customizable** storytelling wheels with user-selected prompts.  
   - **Invite-only access**, with a per-person licensing fee for participation.  

#### **Development Constraints & AI Integration Strategy:**  
- We **do not have the budget** to hire a full development team to build this app from scratch.  
- We **do have** front-end development skills and access to graphic designers.  
- We want to **leverage AI-powered tools and no-code/low-code platforms** to develop both the mobile app and the website efficiently.  

#### **Key Questions & Guidance Needed:**  

1. **AI & No-Code/Low-Code Development Options:**  
   - What are the best AI tools and platforms (e.g., GPT-based assistants, no-code/low-code solutions, AI-generated code tools) to build this?  
   - Can AI assist in building a cross-platform app (React Native, Flutter, etc.), and if so, what tools should we explore?  
   - How can we integrate **speech-to-text AI** for transcriptions or optional captions on recorded stories?  
   - Are there AI tools that can help with **audio enhancement** (e.g., noise reduction, sound leveling) for recorded stories?  

2. **Backend & Data Management:**  
   - What is the best approach for **storing and managing audio files** efficiently (cloud storage, database solutions)?  
   - How should we handle **user authentication and profiles** securely, given social networking elements?  
   - What **database or backend services** (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, AWS Amplify) are recommended for scalability and affordability?  

3. **Web & Mobile Integration:**  
   - How can we ensure a seamless experience between the **web-based version** and the **mobile app**?  
   - Are there specific **cross-platform development frameworks** that would work best given our constraints?  

4. **Monetization & Payment Integration:**  
   - What are the best **third-party payment solutions** for handling one-time purchases and subscription-based licensing?  
   - How can we implement **secure transactions** for private group licenses?  

5. **User Engagement & Growth Strategy:**  
   - How can we **optimize AI-driven content discovery** within the app (e.g., personalized recommendations for stories)?  
   - What **growth and engagement tactics** should we consider to encourage user participation and social sharing?  

### **Conclusion:**  
Given our budget and technical constraints, we need a **practical, step-by-step roadmap** for leveraging AI and automation to bring *The Story Portal* to life. We are looking for **detailed recommendations on tools, platforms, and best practices** to help us develop, launch, and scale this project successfully.
