Here’s a structured outline synopsis of everything I currently know about your stage art installation **The Story Portal**, gathered from our previous conversations. This should serve as a strong foundation for the more specific questions you’d like to explore:

---

## **Concept & Purpose**
- **Interactive Storytelling Stage** designed to make empathy contagious through spontaneous, authentic storytelling.  
- **Facilitator Tool**: A giant *“Price is Right”* style wheel with 20 prompts.  
- Participants spin the wheel and share a personal story based on the selected prompt.  
- Core mission: to create spaces where vulnerability and empathy can ripple outward in a community setting.  

---

## **History & Appearances**
- **Burning Man 2012**: Featured in a Dutch documentary project where strangers from the Netherlands experienced Burning Man, with *The Story Portal* included as an interactive installation.  
- **Love Burn 2024 (Miami, FL)**: Presented as a full-featured storytelling stage installation.  
- **Love Burn 2025**: Currently in planning. You are working to inspire the 2024 crew to return.  
- **IngenuityFest 2024 (Cleveland, OH)**: Brought as part of an interactive art and storytelling showcase.  

---

## **Physical Stage Setup**
- **Stage Dimensions**:  
  - Width: 24 ft  
  - Depth: 12 ft  
- **Audience Shade Structure**:  
  - Height: 12 ft  
  - Begins 5 ft from stage front  
  - Depth: 20 ft  
- **Backdrop**: CNC-cut filigree design with gears, forming a projection-mappable surface for nighttime shows.  
- **DJ Booth**: Positioned at center stage in front of the wheel, toward the front edge.  
- **Lighting/Projection**: Stage backdrop is designed for projection mapping at night.  

---

## **Crew & Facilitation**
- Crew assembled for Love Burn 2024.  
- Strategy for Love Burn 2025 is to **retain and inspire the prior team**.  
- You (Robert Rhu) serve as project leader and primary facilitator.  

---

## **Technical & Artistic Enhancements**
- **Wheel**: Large, physical, spinning wheel (festival-scale, not digital).  
- **Audio/Visual Integration**: Plans for projection mapping, lighting effects, and possibly sound design enhancements.  
- **Potential Flame Effects**: You’ve explored propane effects (7 total) with 12v igniters, flame sense, and auto-reignition concepts for future integration.  
- **Stage Art Identity**: Combines theatrical set design, interactive art, and performance facilitation.  

---

## **Festival Positioning & Booking**
- Already presented at regional events (Love Burn, IngenuityFest).  
- Targeting additional bookings at large-scale festivals, including **Okeechobee 2026**.  
- You’ve asked about **how to approach festival producers** for official bookings and partnerships.  

---

## **Future Development**
- **App & Digital Extension**:  
  - You are developing *The Story Portal* as both a mobile app and browser-based platform.  
  - Includes a digital version of the spinning wheel, story recording/sharing, and social networking features.  
  - Monetization planned via topic packs, private group spaces, and licenses.  
- **Brand Growth**: Integration across physical festival installations, live facilitation, and digital storytelling platform.  
- **Vision**: To scale *The Story Portal* as both a physical and digital storytelling ecosystem.

Would you like me to now **expand this into a master “living document”** (almost like a festival-ready portfolio dossier) that covers mission, history, technical rider, stage setup, booking pitch, and digital strategy in one unified reference? That way, you’d have a polished foundation to work from for proposals, funding asks, and outreach.
