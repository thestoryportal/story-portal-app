We are creating custom story topic panels for The Story Portal wheel that are intended for Love Burn 2026. The topic panels will be to go along with the theme of “Island of Broken Toys”. The theme concept is all about how each of us are not perfect and ‘broken’ in one way or another throughout our lives and on our day to day. What are some possible story topic panels to prompt people to share their story in this theme when they spin out story wheel?

Would you like a **filtered top 20** that blends emotional + humorous + theme-driven panels into a final version for the wheel?

Or would you like:
- A **color-coded system** (e.g., serious, funny, weird)?
- Icons/emoji for each panel?
- A physical layout/mockup of the panel labels?

I can also generate PDF or image-ready templates if you'd like printable versions.
